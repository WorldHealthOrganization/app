# Server Setup

Documentation on settings up the servers from the Terraform to manually configured
settings.

## Policies

The team has adopted a number of policies to improve transparency, security and
auditability of the project. The main principle is:

**All Production server changes should go through review before being applied
and should be public.**

This review includes manual changes to settings, e.g. Analytics. All of which
are documented under source control. They should be code reviewed and merged
before being applied in production. This page including the [Terraform
Setup](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app/blob/master/server/terraform/README.md#Terraform-Setup)
and [Manual Setup](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app/blob/master/server/terraform/README.md#Terraform-Setup)
are the definitive record of the server setup. Other documents should be
updated to match this.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform is used for [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (Iac).
Beyond the normal benefits of IaC, it serves essential roles for the WHO App
for transparency and security. Team policy is to use IaC and in particular Terraform
for as much configuration as possible. Particularly the WHO production servers.

### Privacy as Code (PaC)

The motivation is to improve the privacy and auditability of the server.
This should allow for maximum transparency in the entire system from the
server to the client code. That helps to create trust and makes it easier
for people to discover problems and suggest improvements.

This policy applies to both changes to the code and any manual server
configuration. The policy is to prefer that manual changes are done
programmatically where possible, e.g. using Terraform.

### Exceptions

The goal is to make as much of the changes and server configuration as public
as possible. Exceptions to this should be as narrow in scope and duration as
possible. They include the following:

- Emergency actions for stability, attacks or other unforeseen event
- Intrusion detection systems and case investigation
- Spam, abuse, security and other controls where public disclosure of
  certain parts would diminish the security or effectiveness of the system
- Identity of people with server access to reduce targeted attacks on them.
  These people are known and approved individually by WHO. They employ
  special security practices to guard against compromise

Any changes not in the public repository must be documented elsewhere and
reviewed. Emergency actions should be reviewed as soon as possible after
the emergency is resolved.

## Terraform Setup

### Development Organization

To allow development to be done more easily by the open source community. A
development organization is maintained at whocoronavirus.org separate from
WHO production infrastructure. This organization and the projects it hosts
set an expectation of no privacy. Release versions of the app must never
connect to these development servers.

The development organization is outside of WHO control and responsibility.
Along with no privacy expectations, it makes it easier to grant access and
do development. This access does not give any access to the WHO production
infrastructure.

To start with, use a Google Cloud organization of your own. At some point,
you can approach one of the maintainers about access to the development
organization.

### Terraform Service Account

Service accounts are used by Terraform to create and edit the cloud projects.
To maintain separation between these accounts and the projects they're
managing, follow these instructions to create a `who-terraform-admin`
project (this already exists in the development organization):

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community/blob/master/tutorials/managing-gcp-projects-with-terraform/index.md#create-the-terraform-admin-project

This creates a Terraform service account with the permissions for:

- Billing Account User
- Project Creator

Secondly grant the service account access to the DNS records:

1. https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/home?hl=en
1. Select domain you own
1. Scroll down to bottom and select "Add an owner", example for dev org:

```
terraform@who-terraform-admin.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Terraform access to the WHO production project is limited to only the project
itself and not the wider organization. The service account is created within the
project instead. The who-mh-prod-in-dev project is used to replicate this
environment in the development organization. Starting from a newly created empty
project, create a `who-terraform-prod-admin`
[service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
with the following permissions (required to create App Engine instance):

- Project Owner

### Setup

- [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/gcp-get-started)
- [Service Account Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=who-terraform-admin&folder=&organizationId=&supportedpurview=project)
- Ask maintainers for access (limited to small group)
- Create a new key
  - Visit (example for development organization): https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?project=who-terraform-admin&organizationId=532343229286
  - Service Account: select "Terraform"
  - Click "Create", download file

Configure the credentials:

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to json credentials>
```

This uses the `terraform@who-terraform-admin.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service account
in the `who-terraform-admin` project. To complete the setup, navigate to a particular
directory and apply the project:

```sh
cd server/terraform/prod-in-dev

terraform init
terraform apply
```

Note: This may fail with the following error
`Error: googleapi: Error 409: Sink _Default already exists, alreadyExists`.
due to https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/7811.

Run import and re-apply to continue.

```sh
terraform import module.myhealth.google_logging_project_sink.default projects/$PROJECT_ID/sinks/_Default
terraform apply
```

See the [Production Setup](#production-setup) for special instructions for the
`who-mh-prod` and `who-mh-prod-in-dev` projects. The other projects don't need
any special setup.

### Current Projects

The WHO Production server is the only server that follows the privacy policy.
There is no expectation of privacy for the development organization projects,
which are in the list below. The project renaming is still in progress:

| Server Name        | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| who-mh-hack        | Dedicated server for penetration testing                |
| who-mh-prod-in-dev | Replicates permissions and setup of who-mh-prod project |
| who-mh-prod        | WHO Production infrastructure, Privacy Policy compliant |
| who-mh-staging     | CI server updated from GitHub repo                      |
| who-mh2-dev1       | Development (unstable) environment for v2 backend       |

### New Project

Follow these steps and update the project list above:

```sh
mkdir server/terraform/xxxx
cd server/terraform/xxxx

# Terraform new config should be based on staging
cp ../staging/main.tf .
emacs main.tf

terraform init
terraform apply
# THIS MAY THROW AN ERROR:
#   Error: googleapi: Error 409: Sink _Default already exists, alreadyExists
# IF SO, run the following:
#   terraform import module.myhealth.google_logging_project_sink.default projects/$PROJECT_ID/sinks/_Default
# ... And then run `terraform apply` again.

# Your resources should now exist.
```

### Terraform Apply

`terraform apply` can be used to both create and update the server config:

```sh
# setup
cd server/terraform/xxxx
terraform init

# update resource
terraform apply
```

### DO NOT Destroy Project

As this may leave the App Engine instance in a broken state:
([ref](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/1973)) and
destroy data and IP addresses that can't be recovered.

```sh
# DO NOT DESTROY: will make the project unrecoverable
# terraform destroy
```

### Production Setup

Terraform requires special setup since the service account uses an existing project.
Terraform can't maintain the project state as the `google_project.billing_account`
can only be edited with the "Billing Account User" permissions
(see #terraform-service-account). The `who-mh-prod-in-dev` in the development
organization replicates the permissions model of the `who-mh-prod` project in production.

After creating an empty project with a matching project name, use `terraform apply`
as normal to create and update the project. First time use will produce this error:

```sh
Error: Error creating ManagedZone: googleapi: Error 400: Please verify ownership of the 'prod-in-dev.whocoronavirus.org.' domain (or a parent) at http://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/ and try again, verifyManagedZoneDnsNameOwnership
```

Fix this by setting up a DNS A Record that points to the IPv4 global address.
The DNS A Record is specified in the Terraform domain variable, e.g.
staging.whocoronavirus.org. Use `terraform state` to get the IPv4 address it needs
to point to:

```sh
terraform state show module.myhealth.module.lb.google_compute_global_address.ipv4
# module.myhealth.module.lb.google_compute_global_address.ipv4:
resource "google_compute_global_address" "ipv4" {
address = "34.107.166.96" ...
```

If the service account has "Project Editor" access instead of "Project Owner",
it will produce the following error. This still creates an App Engine instance
but one that can't be edited by Terraform leaving the project permanently broken.

```sh
Error: Error creating App Engine application: googleapi: Error 403: The caller does not have permission, forbidden
```

## Manual Setup

The final setup must be completed manually for each project. This configuration
should be moved to terraform if it is supported in the future.

Production servers must be configured exactly as described here. Changes should
be made through code and merged before being manually applied. Exceptions to this are
defined in https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app/blob/master/server/terraform/README.md#Exceptions.
