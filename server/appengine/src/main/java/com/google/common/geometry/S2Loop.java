/**
 *
 * An S2Loop represents a simple spherical polygon. It consists of a single
 * chain of vertices where the first vertex is implicitly connected to the last.
 * All loops are defined to have a CCW orientation, i.e. the interior of the
 * polygon is on the left side of the edges. This implies that a clockwise loop
 * enclosing a small area is interpreted to be a CCW loop enclosing a very large
 * area.
 *
 *  Loops are not allowed to have any duplicate vertices (whether adjacent or
 * not), and non-adjacent edges are not allowed to intersect. Loops must have at
 * least 3 vertices. Although these restrictions are not enforced in optimized
 * code, you may get unexpected results if they are violated.
 *
 *  Point containment is defined such that if the sphere is subdivided into
 * faces (loops), every point is contained by exactly one face. This implies
 * that loops do not necessarily contain all (or any) of their vertices An
 * S2LatLngRect represents a latitude-longitude rectangle. It is capable of
 * representing the empty and full rectangles as well as single points.
