While we're working quickly, please abide by a few rules to keep us safe and sane:
* Enable 2FA for your account, and use hardware keys if possible (mandatory if you are a committer)
* GitHub Email address needs to match your git commit address
* 2 person rule - the merger/approver must be distinct from the author (including committers/admin)
