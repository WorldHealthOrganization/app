## Process Guidelines

While we're working quickly, please abide by a few rules to keep us safe and sane:
* Enable 2FA for your account, and use hardware keys if possible (mandatory if you are a committer)
* For authors, before you submit a PR for review:
  * Add your name to the [LICENSE](LICENSE) contributor list if its your first commit.
  * Make sure the commit history you propose reflects meaningful chunks of work each of which is of submittable quality and properly licensed, instead of reflecting your iterative development/debugging process as you add or remove code.  For example your corrections during code review should be squashed into the appropriate relevant original commit, not a separate commit just for fixes.
  * GitHub Email address needs to match your git author email address.
  * For each dependency you add, please acknowledge it in your PR description and describe why you chose it, its license, and a summary of how widely it is used in the open source community (do known apps use it?  does it have known backers?)
* For committers:
  * 2 person rule - the approver must be distinct from the author (including for admins).
  * Use squash and merge if intermediate commit history is not of approvable quality.
