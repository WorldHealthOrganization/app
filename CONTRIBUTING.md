## Process Guidelines

While we're working quickly, please abide by a few rules to keep us safe and sane:
* Enable 2FA for your account, and use hardware keys if possible (mandatory if you are a committer)
* 2 person rule - the merger/approver must be distinct from the author (including committers/admin)
* Before you submit a PR for review:
  * Add your name to the [LICENSE](LICENSE) contributor list if its your first commit.
  * Squash your PR down to a single commit.
  * GitHub Email address needs to match your git author email address
