## Process Guidelines

While we're working quickly, please abide by a few rules to keep us safe and sane:
* Enable 2FA for your account, and use hardware keys if possible (mandatory if you are a committer)
* For authors, before you submit a PR for review:
  * Add your name to the [LICENSE](LICENSE) contributor list if its your first commit.
  * Make sure the commit history you propose reflects meaningful chunks of work each of which is of submittable quality and properly licensed, instead of reflecting your iterative development/debugging process as you add or remove code.
  * GitHub Email address needs to match your git author email address
* For committers:
  * 2 person rule - the merger/approver must be distinct from the author (including admin)
  * Use squash and merge if intermediate commit history is not of submittabl quality.
