# Localization

For localization we're using plugins by Localizely

To generate the necessary code, run `flutter pub run intl_utils:generate`
There are also IDE plugins that will automatically update the code when the localization files are modified.

- [Flutter Intl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=localizely.flutter-intl) extension for VS Code
- [Flutter Intl](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13666-flutter-intl) plugin for IntelliJ / Android Studio
- [intl_utils](https://pub.dev/packages/intl_utils) Dart package
