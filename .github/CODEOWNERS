# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. 
#
# Security sensitive items must be at the end.
#
# All user entries should be alpha-sorted and lowercase.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo, unless a later match takes precedence.
# Sadly, we have to repeat the top-level owners everywhere,
# since we are not team-members of a GitHub Organization.
